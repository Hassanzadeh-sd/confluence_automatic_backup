# automatic_backup_confluence
This project implements a robust automatic backup solution for Confluence version 9.0 and later. The primary goal is to ensure the integrity and availability of critical data by regularly creating secure backups of the Confluence instance, including all spaces, pages, attachments, and configurations.
